Topic: geography
Context: occur in space, including the lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. places do not exist in a vacuum and instead have complex spatial relationships with each other, and place is concerned how a location is situated in relation to all other locations. as a discipline then, the term place in geography includes all spatial phenomena occurring at a location, the diverse uses and meanings humans ascribe to that location, and how that location impacts and is impacted by all other locations on earth. in one of yi - fu tuan's papers, he explains that in his view, geography is the study of earth as a home for humanity, and thus place and the complex meaning behind the term is central to the discipline of geography. = = = = time = = = = time is usually thought to be within the domain of history, however, it is of significant concern in the discipline of geography. in physics, space and time are not separated, and are combined into the concept of spacetime. geography is subject to the laws of physics, and in studying things that occur in space, time must be considered. time in geography is more than just the historical record of events that occurred at various discrete coordinates ; but also includes modeling the dynamic movement of people, organisms, and things through space. time facilitates movement through space, ultimately allowing things to flow through a system. the amount of time an individual, or group of people, spends in a place will often shape their attachment and perspective to that place. time constrains the possible paths that can be taken through space, given a starting point, possible routes, and rate of travel. visualizing time over space is challenging in terms of cartography, and includes space - prism, advanced 3d geovisualizations, and animated maps. = = = = scale = = = = scale in the context of a map is the ratio between a distance measured on the map and the corresponding distance as measured on the ground. this concept is fundamental to the discipline of geography, not just cartography, in that phenomena being investigated appear different depending on the scale used. scale is the frame that geographers use to measure space, and ultimately to understand a place. = = = laws of geography = = = during the quantitative revolution, geography shifted to an empirical law - making ( nomothetic ) approach. several laws of geography have been proposed since then, most notably by waldo tobler and can be viewed as a product of the
